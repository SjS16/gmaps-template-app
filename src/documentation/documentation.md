# Technical Documentation

This app is built off the base sb-extension-app and uses an embedded Google Maps Iframe to display Google Maps. There is also a custom swappable address component, which uses simple html components.

The Google Maps component requires an address (the more specific you are the better), has an option for satellite or map view, and offers fixed (give it a width and height in pixels) or responsive view option. The address component accepts two adderss lines (one is optional), a zip code, a country and optional email and telephone section. This does not interact with the google maps component, so users need to make sure they match up.
